SPARC TASK LIBRARY:
------------------
This is the version of the USL task library for Sun's SPARC
archtecture.  The code was ported to the SPARC architecture by
SUN and is being distributed by USL.  It is based upon release 
3.0 of the USL task library.  NOTE: This product is NOT supported
by USL, it is not part of the standard USL 3.0 C++ release.  It 
is being distributed as a service to our customers.

BUILDING INSTRUCTIONS:
---------------------
This directory contains the source code used to build a version of 
the task libraries for Sun's SPARC architecture.  There are TWO 
directories; mk and task.  The task directory contains the source
code used to build the task library, libtask.a.  The mk directory
contains the makefile to build the library, and once built the
library (libtask.a) and object files (.o's).   Before building 
the library you will need to edit the mk/makefile and set
CC to your C compiler, CCC to your C++ compiler, and CCFLAGS to
any compile time options you would like to use.  You should not
have to change any other variables.

KNOWN PROBLEMS:
--------------
This version of the task library does not work properly when 
SHARED tasks are specified.  Applications that use SHARED
tasks may dump core when run.  The problem should go away if
DEDICATED tasks are used.  For more information on SHARED vs.
DEDICATED tasks see section 2 of the USL Library Manual.
