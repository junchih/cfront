Comments on the programs for counting Non-Comment Source Lines
NCSL and NCSLDIFF

NOTICE-NOT TO BE DISCLOSED OUTSIDE AT&T EXCEPT UNDER WRITTEN AGRMT

To compile NCSL and NCSLDIFF, use the command:
 
     make

The time function in ncsl is set for eastern standard time.  NCSL does not
know about TZ.  If you want to change it change the value for "timezone".
