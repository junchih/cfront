This directory contains example tasking programs.
    triv:	A trivial tasking program with tasks that pass
		an object around via queues.

    regtest:	A somewhat less trivial tasking program that also has
		tasks passing an object around via queues.  It includes
		extraneous code to check that registers are being
		restored correctly across task switches.	

    shared:	Similar to regtest, but uses SHARED tasks (tasks that
		share the same stack space), and does not have the
		extraneous register-checking code.

    alph:	A program with 2 tasks communicating via semaphores.

    sigtest:	A program to illustrate the signal-handling features
		of the task library.  Two tasks communicate and synchronize
		with signals and semaphores.

Compile with:  make compile
Compile and run with:  make run
Files suffixed .V contain the expected output for each program.
Note:  the makefile sets the library search path to be ../..,
that is, the compiler (linker) looks in ../.. for libtask.a.
